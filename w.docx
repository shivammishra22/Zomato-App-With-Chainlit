•	If the product brand or trade name is not specified, it should be assumed that it is Jubilant product.

•	If multiple products are mentioned in the abstract/article, a report should be submitted only for Jubilant suspect product. The suspect product shall be the one which is identified by the publication's author(s) as having at least a possible causal relationship with the suspected adverse reaction.

•	Specific Situation Events (SSE) shall also be reviewed in the literature article:

•	Reviews of non-company sponsored Clinical trials/Clinical trial outcomes (Phase I, II,
and III): Article shall be reviewed for identification of ICSR. When ICSR cannot be
identified, the articles shall be used (evaluated) at the time of signal detection if there is
any medical significant information

•	If the literature abstract refers to aggregate literature data i.e. ADRs occurred in group of patients where a single identifiable patient could not be determined, however, there is a suspicion of becoming a valid ICSR, in such case FTA shall be procured and aggregate literature data shall be considered as PCR. The entry of this PCR will be tracked down to the Literature tracker by completing respective fields provided in the Attachment II (Literature Tracker template).

•	Upon receipt of FTA, the information shall be analysed further to be classified as ICSR
or aggregate literature data. If categorised as an aggregate literature data, it shall be used
(evaluated) at the time of signal detection.
