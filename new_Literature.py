For each abstract, evaluate:
1) Strength of evidence (comparators, effect size, stats, consistency, methodology)  
2) Clinical relevance of the effect size  
3) Generalisability  
4) Dose‑response characterisation  
5) Duration of effect  
6) Comparative efficacy

- List any *other* indications mentioned in the abstract.

Respond **exactly** in this format, one item per line:
